Description
--

Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.

Example
--

```
Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```

cpp solutions
---

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        vector<int> v(rowIndex+1,1);
        for (int i=2; i<=rowIndex; ++i) {
            for (int j = i-1; j>=1; --j) {
                v[j] += v[j-1];
            }
        }
        return v;
    }
};
```

Some Ideas
--

Note that the best way to do it is to modify the vector from the end to the beginning, because we know that `v[j]=v[j]+v[j-1]`, modifying `v[j]` won't effect modifying the `v[j-1]`. However, if we modify from the beginning, we need to store the previous `v[j-1]` value.
